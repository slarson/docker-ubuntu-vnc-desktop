# Run on AWS / Docker Cloud

** NOTE! Using AWS will cost you money.  You are recommended to turn off your node when you are not using it to avoid incurring charges at the end of the month for time you are not actually using this system.  You are recommended to check in with the [billing home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/) regularly to make sure you don't get an unexepected bill!

* Create an account on Amazon Web Services
* Create an account on Docker Cloud
* Connect AWS into Docker Cloud

* Create a new node

* Configure the node with a name and disk space and hit create

* Watch as it loads up

* Once the node is configured, load up the docker image as a new service (slarson/docker-ubuntu-vnc-desktop)

* Configure the service with the "docker-x2go-eclipse tag" instead of latest

* Publish port 22.  Note that it will be mapped to a random port that you will connect to with your client.  You will note it below.

* Turn on priveleged mode

# Run/connect to server with a Client

* Now that your container is running as a service on your node, make note of the endpoint address

* Go into the logs and find the autogenerated password for the dockerx account as well

Download the x2go client for your OS from:
http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient

* Create a new session and connect to your server

Host : (Your Server IP) Port : (from the service) Username : dockerx Password : (get it from the Docker logs above).  Choose LXDE as your session type
